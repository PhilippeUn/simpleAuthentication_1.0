# :bust_in_silhouette: Simple Authentication (MENN Stack)
A Nuxt.js application which uses Node.js as Backend with Express.js and MongoDb as database.
It's a small example, how the authentication could work. It's working with jwt and nuxt/auth.
For the signup-part there are some password rules integrated.
